  "about": "I have worked as a web developer since 2016. My first contact with code was when I created my first game. <br /> <br /> I'm currently the Staff Front-end Engineer at Livus. Also, in my free time, I help beginners develop in their careers. I really love my career, is where I can feel like a superhero using JavaScript, and its power to impress users and help to create new superheroes. <br /> <br /> I have been living in Sao Paulo/Brazil with my wife and our little dog. Then when I'm not working we go out to have fun and visit our beloved family.",
